\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Nowadays, the always increasing amount of information available on the
Internet makes it impossible to let it be managed exclusively by humans. One
important remaining challenge in computer sciences is making it possible to
use computers to accomplish tasks that would normally require free will.
Indeed, some tasks can require a significant amount of time without producing
any added value. Automating some of these process would allow one to
concentrate on more complicated issues, thus gaining in productivity.

Our work during this semester (February 2011 - June 2011) consisted in finding
a mathematically correct algorithm in order to automatically sort
«~human-readable~» documents in different categories, and programming an
application using this algorithm to actually accomplish the task.



\section{Needs and goals}


\subsection{What did we want to achieve}

Our intention was to conceive an Open Source product that would be easy to
configure and use, as we could not find an existing one. To reach these
requirements, we had to be able to provide a RESTful\footnote{Representational
State Transfer} API\footnote{Application Programming Interface} that would allow anyone
to try and use our software features. To make it really flexible, we also
wanted it to work on different DBMS\footnote{Data Base Management System}.


\subsection{Why do we think this is useful}

While the internet content keeps growing, we need powerful devices to keep
some order in all human oriented items. Automatically understanding what a
text document is about allows search engines to determine wether a website
suits one's key words or not, our mailboxes to send junk mail directly in the
spam folder, and so on. However, such automated softwares are not available to
anyone, and we still have to order our own web contents by hand.

Working on server side and thanks to a RESTful API, the solution we offer
makes it possible for instance to categorize blogs articles, detect the
language of texts written by different users on a website or to determine
wether or not a comment or an inscription form is a spam.


\section{Studied technologies}

\subsection{Existing solutions}

Nous avons testé quelques applications existentes avant de développer notre
propre solution:

\subsubsection{Apache Mahout}

Apache Mahout is an Open Source tool distributed by the Apache community.
It was designed to be scalable and provides implementations of multiple
algorithms used in machine learning such as K-means, Naive Bayes classifier,
key words, and so on.

Mahout is a Java application working on server side on Hadoop clusters. Its
usage is adapted for large scale calculations on several servers. Installing
it is not an easy task for one has to compile, install and configure Hadoop
and Mahout to make it work.


\subsubsection{RapidMiner}

RapidMiner\footnote{\url{http://rapid-i.com/content/view/181/190/lang,en/}} is
an Open Source application for machine learning, data mining, text
mining, predictive analytics, and business analytics.
It is used for research, education, training, rapid prototyping, application
development, and industrial applications.

La version open source de RapidMiner, appelée «~Community Edition~» est
limitée (beaucoup moins de fonctionnalités que dans la version payante) et ne
peut pas être utilisée dans une application commerciale.


\subsection{Our selection}

We have not been able to find any Open Source software matching all our
expectations.

\section{Our application}
\subsection{Quick overview}
\subsection{Features}

Sorting documents is not a one step process. We decided to go for texts
stemming and tokenization. Therefore, we tried to find existing solutions that
would help us to do so.

\subsubsection{Stemming}

Stemming seemed to be the hardest part, for we had to take in consideration
that texts may be in different languages. Finding a word's root depends on
text language and for we cannot speak whole of them, using a pre-existing
solution appeared to be the best solution to us.
Various open source applications use stemming, but a lot of them use it for
a specific purpose in a specific language (for instance, Sphinx
full-text-search). Snowball Stemmer, on the other hand, has specialized in
stemming text documents only. Therefore, the available application supports
more than 15 latin languages.
Concerning tokenization, the work seemed a lot more doable, and as we
thought, we couldn't find any interesting tokenization application.
