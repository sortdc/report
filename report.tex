\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Nowadays, the always increasing amount of information available on the
Internet makes it impossible to let it be managed exclusively by humans. One
important remaining challenge in computer sciences is making it possible to
use computers to accomplish tasks that would normally require free will.
Indeed, some tasks can require a significant amount of time without producing
any added value. Automating some of these process would allow one to
concentrate on more complicated issues, thus gaining in productivity.

Our work during this semester (February 2011 - June 2011) consisted in finding
a mathematically correct algorithm in order to automatically sort
«~human-readable~» documents in different categories, and programming an
application using this algorithm to actually accomplish the task.



\section{Needs and goals}


\subsection{What did we want to achieve}

Our intention was to conceive an Open Source product that would be easy to
configure and use, as we could not find an existing one. To reach these
requirements, we had to be able to provide a REST API that would allow anyone
to try and use our software features. To make it really flexible, we also
wanted it to work on different DBMS\footnote{Data Base Management System}.


\subsection{Why do we think this is useful}

As said previously, we have not been able to find any Open Source software
matching all our expectations.

While the internet content keeps growing, we need powerful devices to keep
some order in all human oriented items. Automatically understanding what a
text document is about allows search engines to determine wether a website
suits one's key words or not, our mailboxes to send junk mail directly in the
spam folder, and so on. However, such automated softwares are not available to
anyone, and we still have to order our own web contents by hand.


\section{Studied technologies}

Sorting documents is not a one step process. We decided to go for texts
stemming and tokenization. Therefore, we tried to find existing solutions that
would help us to do so.

\subsection{Existing solutions}

Stemming seemed to be the hardest part, for we had to take in consideration
that texts may be in different languages. Finding a word's root depends on
text language and for we cannot speak whole of them, using a pre-existing
solution appeared to be the best solution to us.
Various open source applications use stemming, but a lot of them use it for
a specific purpose in a specific language (for instance, Sphinx
full-text-search). Snowball Stemmer, on the other hand, has specialized in
stemming text documents only. Therefore, the available application supports
more than 15 latin languages.
Concerning tokenization, the work seemed a lot more doable, and as we
thought, we couldn't find any interesting tokenization application.
